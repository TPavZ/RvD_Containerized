English algorithm for the battlefield class
1.	Instantiate the Class (Battlefield) should be a simple line of code for self = self
2.	Def run_game I think will be the hardest part.  I plan on making a for loop but will certainly need to make a few
    iterations of it to get it feeling right
3.	Display welcome is as easy as print(“Welcome to the Battlefield!”)
4.	Define battle I think should be easy enough to plug in the attack methods from robots and dinos
5.	Dino turn would be the start of the battle loop, will code it to wait for the robots turn
6.	Vice versa of dino
7.	Use an input to choose between attacking the tank, damage dealer, or support
8.	Vice versa to dino
9.	Show the user which team won by utilizing the loop in run game to determine which team ran out of health first
